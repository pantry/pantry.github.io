We're proud to annouce the first public release of Pantry, the DevOps Automation tool. Included in this release is Pantry Core and two plugins: Pantry Chef and Pantry Exec. Use the navigation to the right to read about Pantry, what it is, how to use it, and why it's awesome.

Until Pantry reaches 1.0 status, considered it beta software and all caveats apply.
